BRIEF HISTORY OF THE DEPARTMENT

The department was founded in the year 1985. It started a one-year Post Graduate Diploma Course in Computer Science and Applications with thirty seats in 1986 under the headship of Prof. Malay Dutta.  At that time there were only a few institutions in the entire country offering post graduate courses in Computer Science. The objectives of the course were to produce Computer Programmers, Research Scholars, Teachers, Instructors, Computer Professionals. The course continued till 2000. Ph.D program in the department was also started immediately after its inception.


In January 2001 the department started a two-year MSc program in Computer Science after obtaining formal approval from UGC replacing the PGDCSA course, with a student intake of 15 per batch. The capacity was later on increased to 30.

In 2005 the Department started a second M.Sc program - MSc in Information Technology together with the existing MSc programme in Computer Science.
